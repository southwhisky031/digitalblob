# Structure & Content Strategy: Performance Marketing Agency Website

Based on the analysis of top agencies (Tinuiti, NoGood, BAT, WebFX), here is a recommended structure and content strategy for your new performance marketing agency website.

## 1. Core Philosophy & Positioning
To stand out, we need to blend **"Creative Branding"** (like BAT) with **"Data-Driven Results"** (like WebFX/Tinuiti).
*   **Keywords:** Growth, Data, Revenue, Partners, Creative.
*   **Tone:** Professional yet bold, confident, and transparent.

## 2. Proposed Site Map (Information Architecture)
A streamlined structure that guides visitors from "Who we are" to "Proof" to "Contact".

1.  **Home** (Landing Page)
2.  **Work** (Case Studies / Portfolio)
3.  **Services** (Capabilities)
4.  **About** (Culture / Team / Philosophy)
5.  **Insights** (Blog / Trends / Reports) - *Optional for MVP, but recommended for SEO.*
6.  **Contact** (Inquiry / Free Audit)

## 3. Detailed Content Outline

### A. Homepage (The Conversion Funnel)
The homepage should tell a complete story.

| Section | Purpose | Content Strategy | Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hero** | Grabs attention immediately. | **Headline:** Benefit-driven (e.g., "We Turn Data into Revenue").<br>**Subhead:** Specifics (e.g., "Performance marketing for growth-stage startups").<br>**CTA:** Primary ("Get Free Audit"), Secondary ("View Work"). | *Tinuiti (Bold), NoGood (Squad feeling)* |
| **Social Proof (Logos)** | Builds instant credibility. | "Trusted by fast-growing brands" + Auto-scrolling carousel of client logos in monochrome. | *NoGood, BAT* |
| **Value Proposition** | Why us? | 3-4 Key Pillars (e.g., "Data-First", "Creative Excellence", "Full-Funnel"). Use icons or micro-animations. | *WebFX (Revenue focus)* |
| **Selected Work** | Show performance. | 3 Featured Case Studies. Big visuals + Key Result Metrics (e.g., "+300% ROAS"). | *BAT (Visuals), Tinuiti (Metrics)* |
| **Services Summary** | What we do. | Grid layout of core services (Paid Search, Social, SEO, Creative). Interactive hover states. | *NoGood* |

*   **Detail Page:**
    *   **Challenge:** What was the problem?
    *   **Solution:** What strategy did we use? (Show ad creative examples here).
    *   **Result:** Hard numbers. ROAS, CPA reduction, Revenue increase.

## 4. Key Features for "Wow" Factor (Aesthetics)
*   **Micro-interactions:** Buttons that magnetize to cursor, smooth scroll animations.
*   **Dark Mode Option:** Gives a "Tech/Premium" feel (like NoGood).

2.  **Draft Copy:** Write the headlines and descriptions based on this structure.
3.  **Gather Assets:** Collect client logos, case study metrics, and team photos.
