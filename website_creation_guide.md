# The Ultimate Guide to Building a Performance Marketing Agency Website

This guide consolidates research from top global and Korean agencies to help you build a high-converting agency website.

## 1. Top 5 References (Benchmarks)
These are the most relevant models for your new site.

1.  **Tinuiti (US)** - *Best for Copywriting & Messaging*
    *   **Why:** "Love Growth. Hate Waste." - Clear, benefit-driven messaging.
    *   **Takeaway:** Don't just list services; state the *value* (e.g., "We stop you from wasting ad spend").
2.  **NoGood (US)** - *Best for Visual Identity & Tone*
    *   **Why:** "No Fluff" attitude + bold yellow/black design.
    *   **Takeaway:** Be distinct. If everyone is blue/white, go bold.
3.  **BAT (Korea)** - *Best for Brand + Performance Balance*
    *   **Why:** High-end aesthetics that prove they can do branding, not just toggle ads.
    *   **Takeaway:** Use high-quality motion graphics and 3D elements to look "expensive" and capable.
4.  **WebFX (US)** - *Best for Trust & Data*
    *   **Why:** They display "Revenue Driven for Clients" as a live counter.
    *   **Takeaway:** Use specific numbers. "300% ROAS" beats "High ROAS".
5.  **Eco Marketing (Korea)** - *Best for Sales Focus*
    *   **Why:** Very direct about driving sales (D2C focus).
    *   **Takeaway:** Focus the narrative on *sales growth*, not just "marketing".

## 3. How to Fill the Content (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: The Hero Section (Make or Break)
*   **Headline:** Needs to be huge.
    *   *Bad:* "We are a marketing agency."
    *   *Good:* "We Scale E-commerce Brands to $10M+ Revenue."
*   **Subhead:** One sentence explaining *how*.
    *   *Example:* "Data-driven user acquisition for high-growth startups."
*   **CTA Button:**
    *   *Primary:* "Get Free Audit" (High value)
    *   *Secondary:* "View Our Work" (Low friction)

### Step 2: The "Social Proof" Bar
*   Immediately below the Hero.
*   "Trusted by:" followed by 5-6 gray-scale logos of your best clients (or partners).
*   *Tip:* If you don't have big clients yet, use partner badges (Google Partner, Meta Business Partner).

### Step 3: The "Work" Section (Homepage)
*   Showcase exactly 3 "Hero Projects".
*   **Format:** [Big Image] + [Client Name] + [One Key Stat].
*   *Example:* "Client: Musinsa | Result: 450% ROAS in 3 months."

### Step 4: The Services Section
*   Don't just list "Facebook Ads".
*   List **"Paid Social Growth"**.
*   **Feature 4 Core Pillars:**
    1.  **Paid Media** (Meta, Google, TikTok)
    2.  **Creative Studio** (Short-form video, ad design)
    3.  **SEO & CRM** (Organic growth, retention)
    4.  **Data Analytics** (Attribution, Dashboards)

### Step 5: The "About" Section
*   Agencies are people businesses. Show faces.
*   **Team:** High-quality headshots of key members.
*   **Vibe:** A photo of the office or a team workshop.
*   **Philosophy:** "We don't just spend budget; we invest it."

### Step 6: The "Contact" Form
*   Don't just use `mailto:`. Use a form.
*   **Fields:** Name, Company, Website, **Monthly Ad Budget**.
*   *Why Budget?* It helps you prioritize leads (e.g., <$5M vs >$50M).

## 4. Visual & Technical Tips
*   **Motion is Emotion:** Use scroll animations (text fading in) to keep users engaged.
*   **Speed:** Performance agencies must have *fast* websites. Optimize images.
*   **Mobile:** 60% of B2B traffic is mobile. Check your site on a phone constantly.

## 5. Action Plan
1.  **Copywriting:** Write the Hero Headline and Case Study stats first.
2.  **Asset Gathering:** Collect all client logos and best ad creatives.
3.  **Build:** Start with the Homepage -> Work -> Contact structure.
4.  **Launch:** Test the contact form yourself before going live.
